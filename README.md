# 🕶️ VR Room

**Welcome to VR Room** – my very first exploration into the world of Virtual Reality development using Unity!  
This interactive 3D environment is designed to be experienced through a VR headset, providing users with a spatial, immersive room where objects can be interacted with naturally using hand tracking and VR controls.
This is the practice project of the VR Development pathway in Unity Learn [VR Development pathway in Unity Learn](https://learn.unity.com/pathway/vr-development).

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is a foundational VR scene created to explore:

- 🧭 Basic locomotion and teleportation  
- 🖐️ Object grabbing and interaction  
- 🛋️ Placement and layout of furniture and electronics  
- 💡 Lighting and environmental setup  
- 🎯 Interactive elements using XR Toolkit in Unity  

The goal is to lay the groundwork for more advanced VR experiences by understanding how to build believable and interactive spaces.
